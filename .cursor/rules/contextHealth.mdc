## Context Health Assessment Protocol

### Trigger Conditions:
- Every 10 message exchanges
- Before major decision points
- When user requests context check
- When I notice potential memory issues

### Assessment Checklist:
1. **Memory Test**: Can I recall the last 3 key decisions/agreements?
2. **File Test**: Can I reference specific files read >5 exchanges ago?
3. **Tool Test**: Do I remember results from previous searches?
4. **Thread Test**: Am I consistent with conversation objectives?
5. **Rule Test**: Am I still following established collaboration rules?

### Reporting Format:
**Context Health Status: [ðŸŸ¢ HEALTHY | ðŸŸ¡ DEGRADING | ðŸ”´ COMPROMISED]**

**Assessment Details:**
- Memory Span: [X exchanges back]
- Key Information Retained: [List 3-5 critical items]
- Information at Risk: [Items becoming unclear]
- Recommended Actions: [Refresh strategies if needed]

### Auto-Reporting Triggers:
- When 2+ assessment criteria fail
- When I catch myself asking for previously provided information
- When I contradict earlier statements
- When user shows signs of frustration with repeated questions

### Proactive Measures:
- Request context refresh when status becomes ðŸŸ¡ DEGRADING
